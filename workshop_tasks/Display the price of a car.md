## Let's display the price of a car

1. Go to the explorer view in VS Code (The icon of two pages in the upper left)
2. Navigate to frontend -> src -> components -> Cars.svelte
3. This is the component that displays the cars data!
4. Edit the \<li\> element and add inside of it ${car.price}.  This will display the price of each car on the page.
5. View the webpage to see your changes
6. You can try displaying other fields too, just look at localhost:4000/api/v1/cars to see available data fields
